I have managed to get the app up and running smoothly,

1. I have implemented ViewPager with cardView to have the sideways scrolling functionality.
2. Have written custom adapters for the same.
3. Used Retrofit and Glide as main Libraries for providing functionality.
4. The app is not able to pull data from the url most of the time even after writing proper Retrofit code.
5. As the App does not pull the data properly I have added static data to mimic the functionality for the same.
6. The app uses proper Material Design Guidelines.
